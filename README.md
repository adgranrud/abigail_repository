# Abigail Granrud Wicked Problems Exercises
This repository is filled with the first exercises I have completed for the DATA 100 Wicked Problems class.


About Me: I am a freshman at William and Mary interested in studying Neuroscience on the pre-medicine track. I am considering minoring in Public Health and Data Science, so I took this class to learn more about the field of Data Science and how to work with computers. I enjoy learning about chemistry, biology, psychology, and have recently found coding very interesting. With a complete lack of knowlegde when it comes to computers, I have found myself growing as a learner through these exercises. 
# Exercise 1.1 Running Boy

This plot shows a linear path of movement. The plot contains values of x and y up to 10, and plots the values in a continuous sample using a purple dotted line. This is the first plot that I made with R and it is very simple. 
# Exercise 1.2 Person's Path 
![](PersonsPath.md.png)
This is a more challenging plot. The plot contains x and y values up to 100, and shows different shapes to represent homes, small trees, and large trees. A spline is used to show the path of someone traveling to three randomly selected houses in the plot. 
# Challenge Question 1 Traveling Salesman
![](Challengeq.md.png)
This is the most challenging plot I have created with R. This plot contains values of x and y up to 1000, and contains 50 houses, 40 small trees, and 12 large trees. A dashed spline shows the path of a traveling salesman between 7 randomly selected houses.
